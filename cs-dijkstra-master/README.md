# cs-dijkstra
A C# implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm

This implementation reads a graph from a text file and then finds the shortest path from the starting point to the destination point which can both be defined by the user through cli input.
The default graph is taken from Jens Gallenbacher's *Abenteuer Informatik* which I used to prepare for the entrance exam at the Technical University of Vienna.


The graph looks like this:
